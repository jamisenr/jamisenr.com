      It would be a big risk to allow students to create any email on your schools domain, students could create stuff like staff@school.org and launch phishing attacks with an official looking school footer, and ask for payment for a school trip or something.
      I wasn't even looking to find this, but I was messing around with all of Google's tools on my school account, and went to the groups thing. This is meant to be used for well, groups and is like a Google 4chan message board.

    <p>
      I saw the email part, and wanted to look further, so I just filled it out with an email.

    <p>
      Now I have created the group, and am just going to make a post.

    <p>
      We are now at a kind of Gmail looking ui.
    </p>

    <br><img src="../files/blog-content/unlimited-school-emails-google-loophole/12.png" alt="Image showing Google groups page">

    <p>
     But, if we click the from section, we can now send from our groups email instead of ours, but theres no send field! So what can we do about this?
   </p>

    <p>
      Well, if you look over in the right, you can see a Cc button, and now we can input somebody to Cc on the email, effectively just sending it to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      First im going to try sending to my personal email.
    </p>

    <br><img src="../files/blog-content/unlimited-school-emails-google-loophole/15.png" alt="Image showing Google groups page">

    <p>
      And it infant worked! As you can see it sent and the from has the email we setup.

    <p>
      Next I tested it with my school email (and my friends School email).
    </p>

    <br><img src="../files/blog-content/unlimited-school-emails-google-loophole/17.png" alt="Image showing a Google groups page">

    <p>

    </p>
